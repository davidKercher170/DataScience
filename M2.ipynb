Some models in the bucket, however, behave qualitatively differently than others, as demonstrated, for example, by different stability properties of the equilibrium at the origin. How many distinct types of qualitative behaviors do models in this “bucket” exhibit, and what are the values of µ that characterize each group of models?\n",
